# Introduction

## What Is A Data Structure ?

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

## Why Do We Need Data Structures?

1. Organize data efficiently.
2. Perform operations like search, insert, delete quickly.
3. Optimize memory usage.

## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules to solve a specific problem.

## Why Do We Need Algorithms?

1. Solve problems efficiently and correctly.
2. Compare performance (time/space).
3. Write scalable and optimized code.

| **Data Structure**                 | **Algorithm**                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Focuses on **how data is stored**. | Focuses on **how data is processed**.  |
| Examples: Array, Tree, Graph       | Examples: Binary Search, Quick Sort    |
| Passive: Just holds data           | Active: Performs operations using data |
