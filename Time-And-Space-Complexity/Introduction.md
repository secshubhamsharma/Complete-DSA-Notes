# Introduction

## What is Time and Space Complexity ? 

Time and Space Complexity are two fundamental concepts used to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm.

**Efficiency** refers to how much time and space a program takes to complete a specific task.

## What is Time Complexity ? 

Time compelxity tell us the growth in runtime of alogrithm as the input increases. It tells us how the number of operation increase as the size of input inreases 

We mesaure time compelxity by counting it's operation in a program

> In Simple Words:
The time required by the alogrithm to solve given problem is called time complexity of the algorithm 

It's measured in ***Big O notation***

## What is Space Complexity ? 

**Space complexity** means how much memory a program needs to run, depending on how big the input is. It includes memory for variables, data structures, function calls, etc.

> In Simple Words:
Space complexity is the amount of memory your code uses while solving a problem.
